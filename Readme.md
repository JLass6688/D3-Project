##D3 Project

A D3 project that dynamically renders randomly sized, colored circles. Using a transition effect, you are able to see the circles come and go, and move around the screen. By binding an "exploding" function to a click event, it allows the user to click on a circle, which in turn expands the circle to the full width of the screen.
